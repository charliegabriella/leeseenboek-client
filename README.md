# üìö  LEES EEN BOEK  üìö
LEES EEN BOEK is an online community created to inspire people to read more books. Users can share what they are reading with their friends, and discover new books.

## Motivation
I created the Instagram account LEES EEN BOEK (@leeseenboek) in 2017 and while my followers count grew, it became clear to me that people have been wanting to bond over books on the internet for a long time. Websites were people can share and discuss what they're reading/want to read do exist, but are often outdated or broken.

## Features
This application offers the user a book search function.

*Currently in progress:* The user can add the books he/she read, want to read or are currently reading to their own private shelf. 

## Setting up
Important note: to succesfully run this application, you'll need to run the server. The server side of this project is an Express server connected to a Sequelize database. [LEES EEN BOEK Server](https://github.com/charliegabriella/leeseenboek-server)
