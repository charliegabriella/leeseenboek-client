# LEES EEN BOEK

LEES EEN BOEK is an online community created to inspire people to read more books. Users can share what they are reading with their friends, and discover new books.

## Motivation

I created the Instagram account LEES EEN BOEK (@leeseenboek) in 2017 and while my followers count grew, it became clear to me that people have been wanting to bond over books on the internet for a long time. Websites were people can share and discuss what they're reading/want to read do exist, but are often outdated or broken.
