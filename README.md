# :books: LEES EEN BOEK :books:

LEES EEN BOEK is an online community created to inspire people to read more books. Users can share what they are reading with their friends, and discover new books.

## Motivation

I created the Instagram account LEES EEN BOEK (@leeseenboek) in 2017 and while my followers count grew, it became clear to me that people have been wanting to bond over books on the internet for a long time. Websites were people can share and discuss what they're reading/want to read do exist, but are often outdated or broken.
